    TODO: Paste the fibonacci number function that you previously created into this class. Change the text box to use a numeric keypad for input. When the button is pressed, make the label print out the nth number in the fibonacci sequence (where n is the value of the text in the text field). Call an instructor/TA when you're done with this task.

    TODO: Drag a new text field into the view controller, and create an outlet for it here. Make both text fields use the numeric keypad. One text field represents an optional tip percentage (in integer form, e.g 20 = 20% tip), the other represents the total amount of a bill. When the button is pressed, make the label display both the total amount and tip amount (e.g. "total: $100, tip: $15"). Call an instructor/TA when you're done with this task.
